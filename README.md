The screenplay by Jeff Vintar and Akiva Goldsman is from a screen story by Vintar, _based on his original screenplay "Hardwired"_, and suggested by Isaac Asimov's 1950 short-story collection of the same name. 

    The film stars Will Smith, Bridget Moynahan, Bruce Greenwood, James Cromwell, Chi McBride, and Alan Tudyk. In 2035, highly intelligent robots fill public service positions throughout the dystopian world, operating under three rules to keep humans safe. 

Detective ~~Del Spooner~~ (Smith) investigates the alleged suicide of U.S. Robotics founder ~~Alfred Lanning~~ (Cromwell) and believes that a human-like robot (Tudyk) murdered him.
